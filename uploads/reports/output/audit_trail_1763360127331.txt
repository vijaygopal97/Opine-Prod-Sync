SLIDE 7: 7 DMA VOTE SHARE CHART - DETAILED CALCULATIONS
================================================================================

================================================================================
AUDIT: SLIDE 7 - 7 DMA CHART
================================================================================

Chart Description:
  Type: 7 DMA (7-Day Moving Average) Normalized Vote Share
  Data Points: 13 days ending at 2025-11-03
  Dates: Oct 18-31 (excluding Oct 19)
  Chart Categories: Excel serial numbers (45948, 45950, ..., 45961) matching final PPT DateAxis format
  Note: Chart uses DateAxis with Excel serial numbers, not date strings, to match final PPT

Date Range:
  First Date: 2025-10-21
  Last Date: 2025-11-03
  Total Dates: 13
  Excluded: Oct 19

Calculation Method:
  For each date, calculate 7 DMA Normalized Vote Share
  using data from (date - 7 days) to (date - 1 day) = 7 days total, ending one day before the date
  Formula: (Σ Weight for Party in 7-day window / Σ Total Weights in 7-day window) × 100
  Logic: For each date point, the reference date for that 7 DMA is one day before the date
  So if date is Oct 31, 7 DMA uses Oct 24-30 (7 days ending on Oct 30, excluding Oct 31)

Example Calculations:

  Date 1: 2025-10-21
    7 DMA Window: 2025-10-14 to 2025-10-20 (7 days, ending one day before 2025-10-21)
    Records: 9,826
    Total Weight: 18,647,619.25

  Date 13: 2025-11-03
    7 DMA Window: 2025-10-27 to 2025-11-02 (7 days, ending one day before 2025-11-03)
    Records: 11,092
    Total Weight: 23,667,132.63

Demographic Calculations Overview:
  Date Filter (Overall): All data up to 2025-11-03
  Date Filter (7 DMA): Last 7 days ending one day before 2025-11-03
  Date Filter (15 DMA): Last 15 days ending one day before 2025-11-03
  Weight Column (Overall): Weight - with Vote Share - AE 2021 - Region
  Weight Column (7 DMA): Weight - with Vote Share - AE 2021 - Region L7D (7DMA-specific weights)
  Weight Column (15 DMA): Weight - with Vote Share - AE 2021 - Region L15D (15DMA-specific weights)
  Method: Same as Normalized Vote Share, but filtered by demographic category
  Formula (Overall): (Σ Weight for Party in Demographic / Σ Total Weights in Demographic) × 100
  Formula (7 DMA): (Σ Weight for Party in Demographic (7-day window) / Σ Total Weights in Demographic (7-day window)) × 100
  Formula (15 DMA): (Σ Weight for Party in Demographic (15-day window) / Σ Total Weights in Demographic (15-day window)) × 100
  Note: 7DMA calculations use 'Weight - with Vote Share - AE 2021 - Region L7D' instead of regular weights
  Note: 15DMA calculations use 'Weight - with Vote Share - AE 2021 - Region L15D' instead of regular weights

AUDIT: 7 DMA DEMOGRAPHIC CHARTS (SLIDES 24-39)
================================================================================

7 DMA Demographic Charts Overview:
  Chart Type: 7 DMA (7-Day Moving Average) Normalized Vote Share Line Chart
  Data Points: 13 days ending at 2025-11-03
  Dates: Oct 18-31 (excluding Oct 19)
  Chart Categories: Excel serial numbers (45948, 45950, ..., 45961) matching final PPT DateAxis format
  Method: Same as Slide 7 (7 DMA), but filtered by demographic category
  Formula: For each date, calculate 7 DMA Normalized Vote Share using data from (date - 7 days) to (date - 1 day),
           filtered by demographic category
  Weight Column: Weight - with Vote Share - AE 2021 - Region L7D (7DMA-specific weights with fallback to regular weights if <50% available)
  Note: 7DMA calculations use 'Weight - with Vote Share - AE 2021 - Region L7D' when >=50% of records have L7D weights,
        otherwise fall back to regular weights to avoid using sparse L7D weights which give incorrect results.
        Charts use DateAxis with Excel serial numbers.
  Formula: (Σ Weight for Party in Demographic (7-day window) / Σ Total Weights in Demographic (7-day window)) × 100
  Note: 7DMA window ends one day before the date point - window is (date - 7 days) to (date - 1 day) = 7 days total
  Slides: 24-39 (16 charts total)
